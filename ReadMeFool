Hey, So I don't know what I'm doing.  I made a profile (Probably based of of CHEP, but I don't remember).   These Profiles seem to be going well using the following:
        A. TPU Filament - Inland brand from MicroSucker, I mean MicroCenter.
        B. Nylon 230 Filament from MatteHackers (Difficult to find at the moment)
        C.  ASA Filament, located here - https://amzn.to/3KmXocp

2.  Ender 3 Pro with Sprite Extruder (https://amzn.to/3KjUpS8) , Linear Rails, Auto Bed Leveler CR Touch (https://amzn.to/3KjUpS8) , Dual Z Axis. For a nozzle, I am using the Micro Swiss .4mm Nozzle.

This should work for the Ender/Creality S1 as well.
Certainly there are things that can be improved, but this is a good start for someone looking (possibly).

I recommend running A calibration cube and making fine adjustments after.
